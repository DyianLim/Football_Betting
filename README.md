_Data-driven football betting strategy_

Football betting is one of the most popular gambling activity today and betting sites often offer a mulititude of bet types to punters. Bookmakers in turn generate revenue by factoring in an overround to the odds that are offered to punters. These odds are then updated live until the start of the match based on the betting amounts placed by punters in a manner that reduces the total exposure of bookmakers to one side of a bet. Considering this, coupled with the tendency for most gamblers to rely on intuition, we will attempt to create a system that places value bets when they are available.
